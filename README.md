## Installation

- Click on "Releases" on the right and download zip
- Go to `Edit -> Preferences -> Addons`
- Press `Install...`
- Select the archive

In 3D view press N. You'll find new buttons in the menu on the right on the "Substance" tab

# Usage

- Put objects you want to texture into a collection and give them materials. Individual materials will become texture sets in Painter! If an object doesn't have a material it will be created automatically
- Click on the collection you want to texture in the outliner
- Press the `Export [Collection Name] to Painter` button
- When you're done, export textures from Painter (`Ctrl+Shift+E`), and press `Load Painter Textures` in Blender âœ¨

Tip:
- In Blender you can link objects to a collection instead of moving them if you hold `Ctrl` when you drag them in the outliner. This way you can create collections specifically for Substance Painter export and group assets however you like!

# Preferences

In the addon preferences you can configure:

- Substance Painter Path (in case it wasn't automatically detected)
- Texture output folder name. Default is `textures`

# Supported Substance Versions

The addon is working with:

- Windows CC Substance Painter
- Windows Steam Substance Painter (Tested on Substance Painter 2023)
- MacOS CC Substance Painter
- MacOS Steam Substance Painter

Let me know if you have any issues!
